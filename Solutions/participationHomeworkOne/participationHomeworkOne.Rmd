## Participation homework

Here we analyze the system,
$$ x(t+1) = f(x(t)) $$
where,
$$ f(x) = \frac{-1}{4}x^2 + x + 1 $$
for state variable $x$ and time-step $t$.  Specifically, we find the fixed points of this system and analyze their stability.

### Fixed points

A fixed point, $x{\star}$, of this system satisfies,
$$ f(x{\star}) = x{\star} = \frac{-1}{4}x{\star}^2 + x{\star} + 1 $$
Solving this equation we have,
$$ 0 = \frac{-1}{4}x{\star}^2 + 1 $$
$$ \frac{1}{4}x{\star}^2 = 1 $$
$$ x{\star} = \pm 2 $$

### Stability

A fixed point $x{\star}$ is stable if,
$$ |f'(x{\star})| < 1 $$
where $f'(x)$ is the first derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at $x$.  For this system we have,
$$ f'(x) = \frac{-1}{2}x + 1 $$
At the first fixed point we have,
$$ f'(-2) = \frac{2}{2} + 1 = 2 = |2| > 1, \text{ (unstable)} $$
At the second fixed point we have,
$$ f'(2) = \frac{-2}{2} + 1 = 0 = |0| < 1, \text{ (stable)} $$
Therefore, $x{\star} = -2$ is unstable and $x{\star} = 2$ is stable.
