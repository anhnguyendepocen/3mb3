Mini pop quiz (not for marks!)       name:  
------------------------
1. Write down the recurrsion for the geometric growth model. In other words,
    write down an expression for N(t+1) as a function of N(t).

Solution: N(t+1) = R N(t)


2. Write down the time-dependent solution of the geometric growth model.
    In other words, write down an expression for N(t) as a function of t.

Solution: N(t) = N(0) R^t

*FURTHER HOMEWORK* (also not for marks): prove this 
Hint:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction

3. Write down the only value that is *always* a fixed point of the geometric
    growth model.

Solution: N* = 0

4. Write down the condition(s) for the stability of this fixed point.

Solution: |R| < 1
