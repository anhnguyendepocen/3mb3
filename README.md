- Instructor: Dr. Steve Walker. Contact me by (preferred methods)
    e-mailing
    [scwalker@math.mcmaster.ca](mailto:scwalker@math.mcmaster.ca) or
    visiting 412 Hamilton Hall. My **office hours** for this semester
    are mon 1:30-2:20, tues 3:30-4:20, th 9:30-10:20. Meetings during
    office hours are preferred but I can also meet at other times by
    appointment.
-   Teaching assistant: David Champredon
    ([david.champredon@gmail.com](mailto:david.champredon@gmail.com))
    will be running the labs.
- Class times and location: Lectures are in HH/104 on Mon. and
    Thurs. 12:30-1:20 and Tues. 1:30-2:20.  Computer labs are in
    BSB/244 on Tues. 2:30-3:20.  Lecture periods may be used
    interchangeably, for computer work, lectures, or
    demonstrations. You are responsible for all material presented in
    either venue.
- *Textbook:* Mooney and Swift (1999), A Course in Mathematical
    Modeling, Mathematical Association of America (ISBNÂ  088385712X)
    [[Amazon](http://amzn.com/088385712X)]. Other readings from
    primary and secondary sources will be made available on the web.
- *Prerequisites*: calculus II (one of MATH 1AA3, 1LT3, 1NN3, 1XX3,
    ARTS&SCI 1D06, ISCI 1A24); and (co-requisite) linear algebra
    (credit or registration in one of MATH 1B03, 1D03, 1H03, 1HH3; or
    one of MATH 1ZC3, 1ZZ5. ).

  Either you are already here or you need to write this down:
  `https://github.com/stevencarlislewalker/3mb3`.  To download all of
  the currently available course material (recommended), click on the
  `Download ZIP` button on this page.  **Material will be added
  throughout the semester, so you will need to check back and
  periodically re-download**.  You can also browse through the files
  via the links above.  Note however that you may be frustrated by how
  `github` handles `pdf` and `html` files.  This is why its best to
  download the entire repository.  Tip:  `View Raw` and `Raw` buttons
  can be your friend with `pdf` files.
- Computer software and hardware: we will use the open-source
    [R language](http://www.r-project.org) throughout the course. In
    particular, we will use the RStudio development environment, which
    will be available on the computers in the lab, but it will be most
    convenient if you can install both R and
    [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) on your own computer.  Please
    try and install RStudio on your own *before* the first lab.  Let
    us know *before* the lab if you can't manage. (Lab hours (see
    above) are reserved for students in this course and you have
    priority over students not registered in this course at that time.
    However, you should also be able to work there outside of this
    allocated time-slot unless the computer lab has been reserved for
    some other course.) **I hope that it will be possible for students
    to bring (or share) a laptop for work during class sessions.** A
    backup device such as a memory stick is required in order to save
    your work.
- Class rules:
	1. respect others
	2. don't talk while someone else is talking
	3. read lab handouts before labs
	4. try
	5. ask questions
- Assessment: there will be a mid-term exam in class and a cumulative
    final exam during the time scheduled by the registrar's
    office. Other assignments will include weekly problem sets,
    written 'discussion questions' based on primary readings, and a
    group project (short progress reports and an individual, written
    report due at the end of the semester). Final grades will be based
    on the following components:
    1. 10%, class participation
    2. 20%, assignments
    3. 35%, projects
    4. 15%, midterm
    5. 20%, final exam
- Assignments: there will be four homework assignments to hand in for
  marks (5% each).  The due dates for these assignments are on the
  [lecture schedule](https://github.com/stevencarlislewalker/3mb3/tree/master/schedule). Assignments
  are to be submitted by email to
  [David](mailto:david.champredon@gmail.com) **before lecture** on the
  day they are due, **with the subject `3MB3 homework`**.  Each
  assignment is associated with a particular lab sessions (see
  schedule).  All assignments are to be formatted using
  [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which will be discussed
  in the first lab.  An example of a completed homework assignment in
  acceptable format is given under the
  [HomeworkExample](https://github.com/stevencarlislewalker/3mb3/tree/master/HomeworkExample)
  directory on the course website.
- Participation marks: although you may have experienced otherwise in
  other courses, these marks will not be arbitrary/subjective.
  Occassionally throughout the semester, you will be asked to write
  either David or Steve an email (a few sentences to a paragraph) on
  a particular topic (**subject `3MB3 participation`**).  The purpose of these emails is for David and I
  to be able to assess your depth of understanding of non-technical
  material.  This will allow us to give you feedback and will
  hopefully make the preparation of your final report at the end of
  the term less stressful.  If you do not come to lecture you will not
  hear about these participatory emails.  If you do not send these
  emails you will receive a low participation mark.  Other ways to
  enhance your participation mark is to engage with in-class exercises
  and come to office hours.
- **Course objective:** To learn to apply mathematical tools to solve
    open-ended, real-world problems, to understand the benefits and
    limitations of mathematical modeling, and to critically assess the
    predictions based on mathematical models, as well as to stimulate
    interest in studying more advanced mathematics topics (e.g.
    numerical analysis, differential equations, probability and
    statistics, and optimization.)

## Course Content

- The course will involve *creative and empirical model construction*.
    Given real-world scenarios, students will learn to identify a
    problem, make appropriate assumptions, propose a model, test the
    assumptions, refine the model if necessary, fit the model to data
    if appropriate, analyze the underlying mathematical structure of
    the model in order to appraise any sensitivity of the conclusions
    to the assumptions and model construction.
- Students will learn model analysis. Given a model, they will learn
    to work backwards to uncover any ** implicit assumptions, assess
    critically how well the assumptions reflect the scenario at hand,
    and estimate the sensitivity of predictions to modifications of
    the assumptions.
- The course will focus on modeling of dynamical systems, with an
    emphasis on biological systems; deterministic discrete-time,
    stochastic discrete-time, and deterministic continuous-time
    (ordinary differential equation) models will be covered.
- The computer language R will be introduced. This package can be used
    for graphical displays of data, numerical solutions of different
    dynamical systems, and simulation modeling.

## Legal stuff

### Policies

1.  **Policy on missed work or lectures:** You should be aware of the
    [Policy For Absence from School Due to Illness or Compassionate Reasons](http://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=559#Requests_for_Relief_for_Missed_Academic_Term_Work)
    It is important to know your rights and your responsibilities. If
    you must miss a presentation or cannot submit assigned work on
    time for a valid reason (e.g., medical reasons, etc.) you may be
    able to obtain an excused absence by taking appropriate
    documentation (e.g.  note from physician) to the Faculty/Program
    office and then discussing this with your instructor. If the
    Faculty/Program gives its approval, the final examination will
    then be given the appropriate extra weighting. Otherwise, a grade
    of zero will be entered for the missed work.

    If you must miss a lecture, it is your responsibility to find out
    what was covered. The best way to do this is to borrow a classmate's
    notes, read them over, and then ask your instructor if there is
    something that you do not understand.

2.  I reserve the right to change the weightings in the grading scheme.
    If changes are made, your grade will be calculated using the
    original weightings and the new weightings, and you will be given
    the higher of the two grades. At the end of the course the grades
    may be adjusted but this can only increase your grade and will be
    done uniformly. I will use the following grade chart to convert
    between letter grades, grade points and percentages:
	* A+, 12, 90
	* A, 11, 85-89
	* A-, 10, 80-84
	* B+, 9, 77-79
	* B, 8, 73-76
	* B-, 7, 70-72
	* C+, 6, 67-69
	* C, 5, 63-66
	* C-, 4, 60-62
	* D+, 3, 57-59
	* D, 2, 53-56
	* D-, 1, 50-52
	* F, 0-49
    (from p. 29 of the [current Undergraduate
    calendar](http://registrar.mcmaster.ca/CALENDAR/PDF-Archive/McMaster_UG_Calendar-2013-2014web.pdf))
    
    
3.  No calculators or other aids will be allowed during examinations
    unless explicitly indicated.
     
4.  You will be required to bring your official McMaster University
    photo identification card to the final examination.
     
5.  Students' grades will be returned by email, **using the official
    email I receive in the class list**.

### Academic Integrity

You are expected to exhibit honesty and use ethical behaviour in all
aspects of the learning process. Academic credentials you earn are
rooted in principles of honesty and academic integrity.

Academic dishonesty is to knowingly act or fail to act in a way that
results or could result in unearned academic credit or advantage. This
behaviour can result in serious consequences, e.g. the grade of zero on
an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on the transcript
(notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic dishonesty"), and/or
suspension or expulsion from the university.

It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic
dishonesty. For information on the various types of academic dishonesty
please refer to McMaster's [academic
integrity](http://www.mcmaster.ca/academicintegrity/students/index.html)
web page.

Here are four common examples of academic dishonesty:

1.  *Plagiarism*: For example, the submission of work that is not one's
    own or for which other credit has been obtained.
2.  *Improper collaboration*: In this course, you are encouraged to
    discuss the assigned problems with other students in your class.
    However, when the work is not explicitly assigned as a group project
    you must write the solutions in your own words without referring to
    any other students' work. The copying or even paraphrasing of
    anyone's solutions will be considered academic dishonesty. For group
    projects, you will be asked to report your own assessment of how you
    contributed to the group's work.
3.  *Copying or using unauthorized aids in examinations*: In this course
    you are not allowed to talk to or communicate in any way (e.g. pass
    notes) with anyone but the instructor or the invigilators during an
    examination.
4.  Continuing to write once the announcement that the alloted time for
    a test or examination is over without the express consent of the
    instructor or one of the invigilators.
