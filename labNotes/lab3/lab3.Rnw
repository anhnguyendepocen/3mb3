\section{Basic matrix manipulation}

R uses \code{matrix} to enter matrices:

<<>>=
(X <- matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 0.1, 0, 0.4, 1.5, 0, 0.2), nrow = 3))
@ 

You need to specify \emph{either} \code{nrow} or \code{ncol};
R will figure out the other dimension of the matrix.  You must
encapsulate your values within \code{c()}, or you will (if you're
lucky) get an error or (if not) get something other than what you expected.
Also notice that, by default, R specifies matrices \emph{by column}: if you
want you can explicitly specify \code{byrow=TRUE} (doing this,
and formatting your code so that the values for each row on are
a separate line, is a good way to preserve your sanity when
entering large matrices). For example:
<<>>=
X <- matrix(c(0, 0.1, 1.5,
              1,   0, 0,
              0,   0.4, 0.2),
            byrow = TRUE,
            nrow = 3)
@ 

You may be wondering if vectors in R 
are row vectors or column vectors (if you don't know what those are,
don't worry). The answer is ``both and neither''.
Vectors are printed out as row vectors, but if you use a vector in 
an operation that succeeds or fails depending on the vector's orientation, 
R will assume that you want the operation to succeed and will proceed as 
if the vector has the necessary orientation. For example, R will let
you add a vector of length 5 to a $5 \times 1$ matrix or to a 
$1 \times 5$ matrix, in either case yielding a matrix of the 
same dimensions.

\code{t(X)} & transpose (exchange rows and columns) of matrix \code{X} \\
\code{dim(X)} & dimensions of matrix \code{X}. \code{dim(X)[1]}=\# rows, \code{dim(X)[2]}=\# columns \\

\code{diag(v,n)} & diagonal $n \times n$ matrix with $v$ on diagonal, 0 elsewhere

%Exercise 1*.  Is \code{X} irreducible?  Prove your answer.
%Is it primitive?  How do you know?  (It may help to draw
%a picture illustrating the loops.)

<<eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE>>=
all(X %*% X %*% X>0)
@ 

Exercise 1. Assume that \code{X} is a matrix for a discrete-time linear
multivariate deterministic model in recurrsion form (i.e. $\mathbf n(t+1)
= \mathbf X \mathbf n(t)$). Calculate $\mathbf n(1)$ given that, 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf n(0) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Hint: matrix multiplication in \code{R} is done with the \code{\%*\%}
operator (Table 1). Now calculate $\mathbf n(t+2)$.
<<Exercise1Ans, eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE>>=
n0 <- rep(1,3)
X%*%n0
@ 



The conceptually simplest way to calculate the state at a given time
step is -- as always -- to use a \code{for} loop, 
<<>>=
n0 <- rep(1, 3)
n <- n0 # start the state at n0
t <- 5 # target the fifth time-step
for(i in 1:t) n <- X %*% n # update the state t times
print(n) # print the state
@ 
Note that we deleted the old state each time we updated the
recurrsion. If we want to save all of these intermediate values of the
state, we need a matrix of states rather than just a vector. This is
because our multivariate state requires one matrix dimension for time
and one for its multiple variables. For example,
<<>>=
N <- matrix(0,t+1,3) # t+1 because we need room for the initial state
N[1,] <- n0 # store the initial state
for(i in 1 + (1:t)) N[i,] <- X %*% N[i-1,]
print(N)
@ 
Note that the final row contains the same numbers in \code{n}.

The explicit closed form solution of $\mathbf n(t+1) = \mathbf X
\mathbf n(t)$ is $\mathbf n(t) = \mathbf S \mathbf D^t \mathbf S^{-1}
\mathbf n(0)$, where $\mathbf S$ is a matrix whose columns are the
eigenvectors of $\mathbf X$ and $\mathbf D$ is a diagonal matrix with
the eigenvalues of $\mathbf X$ on the diagonal. In \code R, $\mathbf
S$ can be obtained by,
<<eigenvectors>>=
(S <- eigen(X)$vectors)
@ 
Similarly, the diagonal of $\mathbf D$ is,
<<eigenvalues>>=
(d <- eigen(X)$values)
@ 
and to put these in a diagonal matrix to obtain $\mathbf D$,
<<diagonal>>=
(D <- diag(d,nrow=length(d)))
@
Note that there are complex numbers. Nevertheless the closed-form
solution still works, even though we know that the state variable
$\mathbf n$ can only take on real numbers. If the answers you get
from the closed-form solution have imaginary parts, they will be
exactly zero and therefore not relevant; you may want to make use of
the \code{Re} function (Table 1), which extracts the real part.

Exercise 2. Verfiy that the explicit time-dependent solution using
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $\mathbf X$ gives the correct value of
$\mathbf n(5)$. Verify also by explicitly multiplying $\mathbf X$ by
itself five times (i.e. by calculating $\mathbf{XXXXXn}(0)$).

<<Exercise3Ans,echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
Re(S %*% D^5 %*% solve(S) %*% n0)
X %*% X %*% X %*% X %*% X %*% n0
@ 

There is something amazing about the first eigenvector. This first,
dominiant, eigenvector is approximately a constant multiple of the
state vector after the model has been run a large number of time
steps,
<<stableage>>=
Re(S %*% D^100 %*% solve(S) %*% n0) # state after 100 steps
Re(S[,1]) # first eigen vector
@ 
To see the proportionality more easily, we define a normalization
function,
<<normalize>>=
normalize <- function(x) {
  x/sum(x)
}
normalize(Re(S %*% D^100 %*% solve(S) %*% n0))
normalize(Re(S[,1]))
@ 

Because this is a linear system it has a fixed point at
$\{0,0,0\}$. The eigenvalues tell us about the stability of this
point. In particular, if all of the eigenvalues have an absolute value
(or modulus for complex eigenvalues) of less than one, then the fixed
point at the origin is stable. For example, our example system is
stable because,
<<stability>>=
all(Mod(d) < 1)
@ 

To plot the first 20 time steps of this model we modify the \code{for}
loop above,
<<plot>>=
N <- matrix(0,20+1,3)
N[1,] <- n0
for(i in 2:21) N[i,] <- X %*% N[i-1,]
plot(0:20, N[,1], ylim = range(N), type = "n")
for(i in 1:3) lines(0:20, N[,i], lty = i)
@ 

Exercise 3. Modify this code to add (a) an x-axis label, `time-step',
(b) y-axis label, `state', and (c) legend identifying the different
line types used for the three different states.

%Exercise 1. If \code{X} represents a demographic matrix,
%what is the expected long-term growth rate of the population?
%Is it growing or shrinking?  Copy \code{X} to a new matrix
%\code{Y} and change \code{Y} in some way that leads to 
%a growth rate that is just $<1$, if the original growth
%rate was $>1$, or vice versa.

<<eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE>>=
eigen(X)$values[1]
Y <- X
Y[1,3] <- 1.8001
eigen(Y)$values[1]
@ 
% maxima
% (%i37) m : matrix([0,f1,f2],[s1,0,0],[0,s2,s3]);

Exercise 4. Show that starting with initial values of either
$\{1,1,1\}$ or $\{1,0,0\}$ gets you to the same state after 100 time
steps (you can either use a \code{for} loop or the \verb+%^%+ operator
from the \code{expm} package), and these states are the same as the
first eigenvector.  Don't forget to normalize!

<<echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
library(expm)
normalize(X%^%100 %*% c(1,1,1))
normalize(X%^%100 %*% c(1,0,0))
@



<<echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
L0 <- eigen(X)$values[1]
Y <- X
delta <- 1e-5
Y[1,3] <- Y[1,3]+delta
L1 <- eigen(Y)$values[1]
Re((L1-L0)/delta)
@ 


Download the data file \code{horn.txt} from Avenue (under `Content ->
Data`).

<<eval=FALSE>>=
f <- file.choose()  ## on MacOS or Windows this should open a dialog box
@ 
<<echo=FALSE>>=
f <- "horn.txt"
@ 
<<>>=
(X <- as.matrix(read.table("horn.txt")))
@ 

Notice that the row sums are all equal to 100 --- %
these data are in percentages, we want the
\emph{column sums} to be 1:
<<>>=
rowSums(X)
X <- t(X)/100  ## transpose and divide by 100
colSums(X)
@ 

This matrix contains the parameters for a linear model of temporal
changes in the species composition of a forest. The changes in the
abundances of the species depend on the current composition of
species. Therefore, if we start with a forest containing only
big-toothed aspen and nothing else, the composition after one time
step would be,
<<>>=
n0 <- numeric(nrow(X))
n0[1] <- 1
X %*% n0
@ 
The idea here is that big-toothed aspen facilitates the establishment
of certain other species.

Exercise 6* (this will be homework).  Determine the long-run
composition of the forest using a \code{for} loop, the explicit
closed-form eigenvector-based solution, \emph{or} the \verb+%^%+
operator in the \code{exmp} package, and compare it with the dominant
eigenvector (don't forget to normalize!).  Sort the normalized vector
of the long-run composition in decreasing order and produce a bar plot
of the state variable (HINT: type \code{?sort} and \code{?barplot} to
see these help files). The results of a \code{for} loop or the
\verb+%^%+ operator will have names, which will be convenient for your
bar plot). What is the dominant species?  How many species will be
present at frequencies of $>5\%$? Is the origin a stable fixed point
in this model (HINT: What happens if one of the eigenvalues has
modulus of exactly one? Do your best!)
