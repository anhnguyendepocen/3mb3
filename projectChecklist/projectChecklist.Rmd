## Final project checklist

0. Optional: Reinterpret the mathematical form of the initial model in terms of a system that you find more interesting. (suggested deadline: Nov 10)
    - For example, you might be more interested in polar bears, not deer.
1. Analyze the stability and fixed points of the initial model. (suggested deadline: Nov 10/11)
2. Answer the preliminary question.  (suggested deadline: Nov 13-15)
    - Note that there is no simple answer to this question, but instead will depend on how you have chosen to answer it. It is an open ended question.
    - While answering the question you should propose reasonable default values for the parameters.
3. Propose a question of your own.  (suggested deadline: Nov 20)
    - Answering this question should require an extension of the initial model.
    - Consider adding parameters that will represent new conditions, and then asking questions about how the dynamics will respond to changes in the parameters.
4. Check to see if your proposed model is sensible by numerically and/or mathematically analyzing it.  (suggested deadline: Nov 20)
    - If the model is not sensible (a common situation), return to step 3.
5. Answer your own question.  (suggested deadline: Nov 27)
6. Write up your findings in the following format (using Rmarkdown).  (deadline:  Dec 2)
    - A short introduction (~ 1 paragraph) in which you pose your question as an extention to the basic model.
    - A description of your model extension.
    - A description of what analyses you will use to answer your questions.
    - A description of your your results *that are useful for supporting your conclusions*.
    - A short concluding paragraph summarizing your answers and what you would try next.
    - List any references you may have used.
    - A technical appendix, which you should refer to in your results section, giving code and mathematical derivations that are required to reproduce your results.
